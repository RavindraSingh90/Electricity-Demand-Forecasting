# Electricity-Demand-Forecasting

The data of monthly electricity consumption available starting from January 1973 to December 2019. 
We need to forecast the demand for next two years.

## Business Objective
- Need to forecast the demand of electricity for next 1-2 years
- Calculate error metrics (RMSE, RMSPE, MAPE)
- Compare various models including Decomposition, ETS models, ARIMA/SARIMA Models with various parameters etc.

## Expected Outputs
- Provide model validation metrics/accuracy metrics
- Provide demand estimation for next 1-2 years on monthly basis
- Provide which model you selected and reason for selection
